#   julia --project=path/to/eglot-jl path/to/eglot-jl/eglot-jl.jl [SOURCE_PATH] [DEPOT_PATH]

# For convenience, Pkg isn't included in eglot-jl
# Project.toml. Importing Pkg here relies on the standard library
# being available on LOAD_PATH

# In julia 1.4 this operation takes under a second. This can be
# crushingly slow in older versions of julia though.

# - default value:  pwd()
# - command-line:   ARGS[1]

# Get the depot path. In order of increasing priority:
# - default value:  ""
# - environment:    ENV["JULIA_DEPOT_PATH"]
# - command-line:   ARGS[2]
depot_path = get(ENV, "JULIA_DEPOT_PATH", "")

# Make sure that we only load packages from this environment specifically.
